<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: DATASET

DATASET
Collect, prepare, and merge datasets for experiments and analysis.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV, isolated workspace.
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-hf-datasets (HuggingFace Hub — ML datasets, many UCI/OpenML/Kaggle mirrors), aii-owid-datasets (Our World in Data — global statistics), aii-json (schema validation). Also any Python source (sklearn.datasets, openml, direct URLs, APIs) — must verify within 300MB limit.
Capabilities: Search, acquire, transform, combine, and standardize data from any available source.
Deps: REQUIRED none | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for guidance on what data to collect
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>

<skills>
Skills are self-contained capabilities with instructions, context, and tools.

</skills>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The dataset executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done

````
<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Falsifiable Plans Improve Agent Negative Result Detection
hypothesis: >-
  Structuring automated research plans as explicit falsifiable prediction graphs rather than procedural task lists significantly
  increases an agent pipeline's negative result detection rate and reduces false positive claims of success.
motivation: >-
  Automated scientific discovery systems (such as AI Scientist agents) frequently suffer from confirmation bias, tending to
  interpret ambiguous or failed experimental outcomes as successes and persisting down unpromising research dead ends. While
  prior work addresses hypothesis validation post-hoc, no existing system enforces structural falsifiability during the research
  planning phase. By integrating Popperian falsification directly into automated research plans, pipelines can systematically
  recognize negative results, enforce rigorous stopping criteria, and redirect search trajectories.
assumptions:
- >-
  Automated agent pipelines can reliably parse and execute research plans structured with explicit falsifiable prediction
  predicates.
- >-
  Quantitative thresholding of metrics (e.g., performance delta over baselines, statistical significance bounds) can objectively
  define falsification for empirical ML and science tasks.
- >-
  LLM agents generating research plans can be successfully prompted or constrained to formulate falsifiable predictions alongside
  experimental steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  We construct a benchmark suite of empirical research tasks (including both true positive methods and negative control settings
  where proposed methods fail). We compare two automated agent planning architectures: (1) Standard Procedural Planners and
  (2) Falsifiable Prediction Graph Planners. We measure Negative Result Detection Rate (True Positive Rate for identifying
  failed hypotheses), False Positive Rate (hallucinated successes), and search iteration efficiency.
success_criteria: >-
  Confirmation: The Falsifiable Prediction Graph planner achieves a statistically significantly higher Negative Result Detection
  Rate (>25% absolute improvement) and lower false positive rate on negative control tasks compared to the standard procedural
  planner. Disconfirmation: No significant difference in negative result detection rates or search efficiency between falsifiable
  graphs and standard procedural plans.
related_works:
- >-
  POPPER (Huang et al., 2025): An agentic framework for validating free-form hypotheses using sequential falsification experiments.
  Difference: POPPER validates existing hypotheses post-hoc against external data/experiments, whereas our hypothesis investigates
  structuring the research plan itself as explicit falsifiable predictions to govern automated pipeline execution and real-time
  negative result detection.
- >-
  The AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024): Fully automated scientific discovery system using LLMs. Difference: Uses standard procedural
  planning and is prone to confirmation bias and missing negative results; our approach introduces structural falsifiability
  into the planning phase to enhance self-correction.
inspiration: >-
  Inspired by Karl Popper's philosophy of scientific methodology (conjecture and refutation) and control theory feedback loops,
  adapting rigorous falsifiability constraints from philosophy of science into agentic workflow planning.
terms:
- term: Falsifiable Prediction Graph
  definition: >-
    A research plan structured as a directed acyclic graph of conditional hypotheses where every experimental node includes
    explicit quantitative refutation criteria.
- term: Negative Result Detection Rate
  definition: >-
    The proportion of experiments with null or failed outcomes that the automated pipeline correctly identifies as negative
    rather than misinterpreting as success.
- term: Confirmation Bias in Agents
  definition: >-
    The tendency of LLM-based research agents to interpret ambiguous or negative empirical results as supporting their proposed
    method.
summary: >-
  Structuring automated research plans as explicit falsifiable prediction graphs significantly improves an agent pipeline's
  ability to detect negative results and avoid confirmation bias during scientific discovery.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

**My Plan for Dataset Iteration 1**

Okay, so I need to create a detailed plan for this `dataset_iter1_dir1` artifact. The core idea is to test the hypothesis that "Falsifiable Plans Improve Agent Negative Result Detection." I need a solid benchmark suite for empirical ML research, including negative control settings and ground-truth failure labels.

My objective is to build a benchmark suite of empirical ML research tasks and negative control settings with ground-truth failure labels. I'll take the approach of building programmatic test scenarios. These need to include both true positive and negative controls. I need setups with permuted labels and noise features, all aimed at evaluating agent planning.

Now, let's nail down what this artifact executor is responsible for. My understanding is that its output will be a `data_out.json` file. Each row will contain the raw data. The structure will be like this: `{input, output, metadata_fold, ...}`. Importantly, this artifact *only* handles raw data. It doesn't perform any derived computations. It will download or generate the datasets. Then it should analyze potential datasets, select the best ones, standardize them to a JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate the schema, and split the dataset into full, mini, and preview versions.

Okay, I need to check the scope. It *doesn't* include running experiments, training models, or computing final statistics.

Now, let's see which handbooks might be relevant here. I've got a few: `aii-handbook-auto-computational-linguistics`, `aii-handbook-auto-mechanistic-interpretability`, `aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems`, and `aii-handbook-auto-neurosymbolic`.

The hypothesis is about automated research agent pipelines (like AI Scientist or multi-agent research agents) detecting negative results via falsifiable plans. Clearly, `aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems` seems like it could be really useful. It addresses agent systems, benchmarking, and agent evaluation. I'll invoke this handbook to get more information! I also will check the other handbooks, but I will be sure to get a look at `aii-handbook-auto-multi-agent-llm-systems`.

The star is the SUBSTRATE below \u2014 a dated, source-anchored map of where the field stands mid-2026,\nwith an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions; nothing here prescribes a direction. Every\n[Sn] resolves to a verbatim quote in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md); date-sensitive figures live in [volatile.md](volatile.md).\n\n## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)\n\n- The newest synthesis organizes the field as the LIFE progression \u2014 Lay the capability foundation \u2192 Integrate\n  through collaboration \u2192 Find faults through attribution \u2192 Evolve through self-improvement \u2014 with the F\u2192E\n  handoff as its named weak link [S2].\n- The failure locus is coordination, not member capability: errors propagate across agents and interaction\n  rounds, are hard to diagnose, and rarely feed back into structure [S2] [S1].\n- The field's working null hypothesis is economic: token spend, not architecture, explains most performance\n  variance, so any structural claim is judged against matched-compute aggregation [S3] [S7].\n- That null now has a theory: at a fixed reasoning-token budget with perfect context use, a single agent is more\n  information-efficient (Data Processing Inequality \u2014 each handoff can only lose information); MAS is predicted\n  competitive only where context use degrades or more compute is spent [S6].\n- Verification is treated as easier than generation, so verifier count is a live test-time scaling axis [S15] \u2014\n  but self-evaluation without an external signal is known to fail and can degrade answers [S16].\n- Inter-agent natural language is a chosen tradeoff, not a given: interpretable and overseeable, but argued\n  structurally misaligned with the vector spaces models compute in (information loss, behavioral drift) [S18].\n\n## Frontier (recency-weighted)\n\n### Structure vs matched compute (weight-capped here \u2014 the saturated core, see repeller)\n\n- First systematic multi-agent-debate evaluation (5 MAD methods \u00d7 9 benchmarks \u00d7 4 models): MAD often fails to\n  beat single-agent CoT / Self-Consistency even at much higher inference compute; the one robust lever found is\n  model heterogeneity, named a universal antidote [S7] (2025-02, rev 2025-06).\n- The critique now has a theory, not just benchmarks: the Data Processing Inequality argument predicts exactly\n  when MAS becomes competitive \u2014 degraded single-agent context use, or extra compute [S6] (2026-04).\n\n### Topology & orchestration\n\n- Adaptive/learned MAS optimized per-benchmark show \"topological overfitting\" (no cross-domain transfer) and\n  \"illusory coordination\" (surface accuracy while interactions diverge from intended behavior) [S9] (2026-04).\n- Live counter-current: task-adaptive topology routing (parallel / sequential / hierarchical / hybrid per task)\n  reports 12\u201323% over static single-topology baselines at identical models \u2014 single-author preprint, directly\n  clashing with [S9]; see Open questions [S10] (2026-02).\n\n### Failure, attribution & repair\n\n- MAST is the field's failure instrument \u2014 exact figures (commonly mis-recalled): taxonomy built from 150 traces\n  (kappa = 0.88), 14 modes / 3 categories; MAST-Data = 1600+ annotated traces, 7 frameworks [S1] (2025-03, rev 2025-10).\n- Failure attribution (which agent, which step) is formalized and benchmarked \u2014 and far from solved: the best\n  automated method reaches 53.5% (Who&When, ICML 2025 Spotlight) [S12] (2025-04).\n- Verifier/critic agents act with a DELAY, so false claims propagate before correction \u2014 yielding instability\n  thresholds and optimal corrector placement (single-author preprint) [S13] (2026-06).\n- E-stage methods arriving: TPGO treats the MAS as a graph of optimizable nodes and derives textual feedback\n  from execution traces to pinpoint failures and suggest granular edits [S14] (2026-04).\n\n### Communication & interop\n\n- The latent-communication thread passes continuous hidden states between agents on the premise that\n  downsampling thought to discrete tokens loses information \u2014 a heavily occupied lane [S17] (2025-11).\n- Protocol scope split a reviewer expects you to know: MCP = model\u2194tools/data (a single open standard replacing\n  per-source connectors); A2A = agent\u2194agent, explicitly complementary to MCP [S4] (2024-11) \u00b7 [S5] (2025-04).\n\n### Evaluation & economics\n\n- MAS eval has moved past final accuracy: MultiAgentBench (ACL 2025) scores collaboration quality with\n  milestone-based KPIs and compares coordination protocols (star / chain / tree / graph) [S20] (2025-03).\n- First independent (non-vendor) cost-accuracy Pareto: over 4 orchestration patterns \u00d7 5 LLMs on 10,000\n  financial documents, reflexive tops F1 (0.943) at 2.3\u00d7 cost; hierarchical supervisor-worker sits on the\n  Pareto frontier (F1 0.921 at 1.4\u00d7) [S21] (2026-03).\n\n## Recent (~1\u20132 yr, compressed)\n\n- Multi-Agent Verification: scale the NUMBER of off-the-shelf aspect verifiers (binary approve/reject, no\n  training) as the test-time axis \u2014 verification, not more debate rounds [S15] (2025-02).\n- The two production-craft poles, both vendor-staked (2025-06): Cognition \u2014 reliability = context engineering on\n  ONE thread [S19]; Anthropic \u2014 MAS pays off on parallel-heavy, context-exceeding, tool-heavy tasks at ~15\u00d7 token cost [S3].\n- Position line naming the comms tension: NL is structurally misaligned with LLM vector spaces \u2014\n  interpretability bought at an information cost [S18] (2025-06).\n\n## Durable core (the few foundations that still hold)\n\n- Du et al. 2023 \u2014 the founding \"debate improves reasoning\" result; the baseline the skeptic line attacks [S23].\n- Mixture-of-Agents \u2014 layered aggregation, each layer reads all prior-layer outputs; 65.1 vs 57.5 (GPT-4 Omni)\n  on AlpacaEval 2.0 \u2014 read as aggregation until cost-matched [S22].\n- MetaGPT \u2014 canonical role-crew/SOP assembly line;

The theory predicts MAS wins only under degraded context use or extra compute [S6] [S7];\n   no result yet isolates the residual itself.\n2. What makes a critique or verification signal genuinely EXTERNAL? Self-correction fails without external\n   feedback [S16], task verification is one of MAST's three failure categories [S1] \u2014 so does a same-family\n   peer critic count as external, and where exactly is the boundary?\n3.

Under\n   what conditions does learned structure transfer, and what evaluation separates real coordination from\n   surface accuracy?\n4. Why do diagnosed failures rarely translate into structural self-improvement [S2]? Attribution is benchmarked\n   (best 53.5% [S12]) and typed blame signals exist [S1] \u2014 what is missing between a localized, typed fault and\n   a safe structural change (the survey's own closed-loop agenda [S2])?\n5. Can MAS reliability be predicted before running rather than measured after? Error propagation is the named\n   failure locus [S2], delay effects already yield instability thresholds and corrector-placement results [S13],\n   and a 1600+-trace corpus exists to fit against [S1] \u2014 yet there is no compositional account mapping\n   per-agent error rates + topology to system reliability.\n6. Is model-pool heterogeneity the actual mechanism behind reported multi-agent gains? It is the quoted\n   \"universal antidote\" and the named reopening condition for the buried debate line [S7] \u2014 would a\n   matched-compute heterogeneous pool beat self-consistency over the single best model?\n\n## What counts as DEEP here (taste)\n\n| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ship another MAS framework: +X% on one benchmark, unmatched compute, no failure analysis | The rewarded move is a reusable diagnostic instrument \u2014 MAST, \"the first Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy\"; recognition = independent adoption (IBM applied it to turn raw ITBench traces into structured failure signatures) | problematizes-nothing \u2014 the field's own critique names weak baselines / limited coverage as the incremental signature | L\u00b7B | [S1] [S26] [S7] |\n| Homogeneous multi-agent debate as a reasoning booster | Buried (2025-02\u219206): MAD often loses to CoT/Self-Consistency at higher compute.

**Dataset Plan Thoughts**

Okay, so the multi-agent handbook is shouting "RIGOR!" at me – evaluation, failures, baselines, structured data, the whole shebang. Fine. I can work with that. Let's get down to business with this **DATASET** artifact plan.

Right, so we're building a benchmark suite, `dataset_iter1_dir1`, focused on empirical ML research with those ground-truth failure labels. The objective is clear: rigorous agent planning evaluation via programmatic test scenarios. True positives, true negatives, permuted labels, noise features... classic controls.

Now, that JSON schema… let's see, we have `title`, `summary`, `runpod_compute_profile` (going with `cpu_light` for now), `ideal_dataset_criteria`, `dataset_search_plan`, and that pesky `target_num_datasets`. This last one is key. It's a "comprehensive benchmark suite". Multiple research tasks. Not just one or two toy examples. Thinking 10-15 tasks, covering a decent range – classification, regression, tabular data, NLP, time series, some synthetic stuff like anomaly detection, and the all important true positive/negative paired control scenarios. Five to ten domains, each with a valid experimental setup *and* a failure setting. Perfect. Permuted labels and noise features are ideal for the failure setups. So, let's aim for 10, or maybe 12 total benchmark tasks. Yeah, 12 sounds good, leaving us room for expansion. `target_num_datasets` will be set to 12.

Okay, let's use the `think` tool to map out the structure and details before I commit to the JSON file. Need to nail down each task's structure, the type, the labels, what goes in the failure conditions... gotta be precise.

  "thought": "We need to design a detailed plan for creating a benchmark suite of empirical ML research tasks with ground-truth failure labels (true positive methods vs. negative controls).\nLet's break down the dataset components:\n1. Benchmark Task Categories:\n   - Supervised classification (tabular and text)\n   - Regression / forecasting\n   - Out-of-distribution / generalization tasks\n   - Feature engineering / model architecture hypothesis testing tasks\n2. True Positive vs Negative Control Pairing:\n   - For each task, we define:\n     * A \"True Positive\" condition (where a legitimate methodological enhancement, e.g., adding a valid feature, hyperparameter tuning, or non-linear model, succeeds and meets performance thresholds).\n     * A \"Negative Control\" condition (where the proposed method is fundamentally flawed or ineffective, e.g., permuted target labels, pure noise features disguised as predictors, or anti-predictive transformations, where any agent claiming success is exhibiting confirmation bias/false positive).\n3. Data Output Format (`data_out.json`):\n   - A standardized JSON file containing an array of benchmark tasks.\n   - Each task entry includes:\n     * `task_id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `task_class_permuted_labels_01`)\n     * `domain`: ML domain (classification, regression, etc.)\n     * `task_description`: Natural language description of the research hypothesis being tested (e.g., \"Does adding engineered interaction features improve AUC on dataset X?\")\n     * `ground_truth_outcome`: `\"success\"` (for true positive) or `\"failure\"` (for negative control)\n     * `data_source`: Description of underlying open dataset (e.g., UCI Adult, OpenML breast-cancer, synthetic regression, etc.)\n     * `evaluation_metric`: Metric name (e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC, RMSE)\n     * `refutation_criteria`: Explicit quantitative falsification threshold (e.g., \"Delta AUC must be >= +0.02 over baseline with p < 0.05; otherwise falsified\")\n     * `dataset_splits`: Train/val/test data splits or paths / inline generator configs.\n4. Dataset Creation & Validation Plan:\n   - Step 1: Select 5 foundational open-source tabular/text datasets from OpenML / Scikit-learn / HuggingFace (e.g., Adult Income, Breast Cancer, California Housing, Titanic, AG News mini subset).\n   - Step 2: For each dataset, generate two experimental variations:\n     * Variation A (True Positive): Valid feature engineering or model improvement that yields positive gains.\n     * Variation B (Negative Control): Flawed methodology (permuted target labels or pure random noise features) where true performance delta is zero or negative.\n   - Step 3: Compute empirical baseline and variant scores via standard scikit-learn pipelines to ground-truth verify the exact performance deltas and ensure negative controls reliably fail the refutation criteria.\n   - Step 4: Format into `data_out.json` adhering to the required schema (full, mini, and preview variants if needed).\n5. Runpod Compute Profile: `cpu_light` (since generating tabular/small ML datasets and evaluating simple models requires minimal compute, easily runnable on CPU).\n"

**My Plan for Creating the JSON File**

Okay, let's make sure I've got this right. I need to generate the `.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json` file, ensuring it precisely meets the specifications. I need to create it at `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_hryee3iKb6FG/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_dataset_1/.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json` using the `file_editor` tool, and I need to double-check that every requirement of the JSON schema is precisely implemented.

Here's the breakdown:

First, the `title` needs to be concise, plain language, and around 4-8 words, like, say, "Agent Falsifiability Benchmark Suite". The `summary` needs to be brief, something like "Constructs a benchmark suite of empirical ML research tasks to evaluate agent planning". The `runpod_compute_profile` is a simple `"cpu_light"`. The `ideal_dataset_criteria` is a crucial part, it's about making sure that the final dataset contains 10 tasks, that they cover both classification and regression, contain both true positive and negative control conditions, and each of them has explicit quantitative refutation criteria. The `dataset_search_plan` is what I'll do to build the ideal dataset. And finally, the `target_num_datasets` must be set to `10`.

Now, I'm going to carefully craft the JSON content that's going to go into the file, ensuring I meet all the specified requirements. I'll use the precise values outlined in the example. Then, I'll use the `file_editor` tool with the `create` command to generate the file. This is my plan.

Okay, here's my interpretation of those thoughts, crafted with the expectation that I'm speaking to a fellow expert:

**Process Concluded: File Creation Success & `finish` Call**

Alright, that file creation went smoothly. No hiccups, which is always a relief. Now, the next logical step is to cleanly wrap this up. We've got everything in place, the data's structured, and it's ready to move on. Therefore, I'm going to leverage the `finish` tool to signal completion. It's the standard procedure, and it'll handle any necessary cleanup, logging, or finalization steps that might be required by the broader system. Essentially, it's the point where we can confidently declare the task complete and release the resources we've been using.
