<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Falsifiable Plans Improve Agent Negative Result Detection
hypothesis: >-
  Structuring automated research plans as explicit falsifiable prediction graphs rather than procedural task lists significantly
  increases an agent pipeline's negative result detection rate and reduces false positive claims of success.
motivation: >-
  Automated scientific discovery systems (such as AI Scientist agents) frequently suffer from confirmation bias, tending to
  interpret ambiguous or failed experimental outcomes as successes and persisting down unpromising research dead ends. While
  prior work addresses hypothesis validation post-hoc, no existing system enforces structural falsifiability during the research
  planning phase. By integrating Popperian falsification directly into automated research plans, pipelines can systematically
  recognize negative results, enforce rigorous stopping criteria, and redirect search trajectories.
assumptions:
- >-
  Automated agent pipelines can reliably parse and execute research plans structured with explicit falsifiable prediction
  predicates.
- >-
  Quantitative thresholding of metrics (e.g., performance delta over baselines, statistical significance bounds) can objectively
  define falsification for empirical ML and science tasks.
- >-
  LLM agents generating research plans can be successfully prompted or constrained to formulate falsifiable predictions alongside
  experimental steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  We construct a benchmark suite of empirical research tasks (including both true positive methods and negative control settings
  where proposed methods fail). We compare two automated agent planning architectures: (1) Standard Procedural Planners and
  (2) Falsifiable Prediction Graph Planners. We measure Negative Result Detection Rate (True Positive Rate for identifying
  failed hypotheses), False Positive Rate (hallucinated successes), and search iteration efficiency.
success_criteria: >-
  Confirmation: The Falsifiable Prediction Graph planner achieves a statistically significantly higher Negative Result Detection
  Rate (>25% absolute improvement) and lower false positive rate on negative control tasks compared to the standard procedural
  planner. Disconfirmation: No significant difference in negative result detection rates or search efficiency between falsifiable
  graphs and standard procedural plans.
related_works:
- >-
  POPPER (Huang et al., 2025): An agentic framework for validating free-form hypotheses using sequential falsification experiments.
  Difference: POPPER validates existing hypotheses post-hoc against external data/experiments, whereas our hypothesis investigates
  structuring the research plan itself as explicit falsifiable predictions to govern automated pipeline execution and real-time
  negative result detection.
- >-
  The AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024): Fully automated scientific discovery system using LLMs. Difference: Uses standard procedural
  planning and is prone to confirmation bias and missing negative results; our approach introduces structural falsifiability
  into the planning phase to enhance self-correction.
inspiration: >-
  Inspired by Karl Popper's philosophy of scientific methodology (conjecture and refutation) and control theory feedback loops,
  adapting rigorous falsifiability constraints from philosophy of science into agentic workflow planning.
terms:
- term: Falsifiable Prediction Graph
  definition: >-
    A research plan structured as a directed acyclic graph of conditional hypotheses where every experimental node includes
    explicit quantitative refutation criteria.
- term: Negative Result Detection Rate
  definition: >-
    The proportion of experiments with null or failed outcomes that the automated pipeline correctly identifies as negative
    rather than misinterpreting as success.
- term: Confirmation Bias in Agents
  definition: >-
    The tendency of LLM-based research agents to interpret ambiguous or negative empirical results as supporting their proposed
    method.
summary: >-
  Structuring automated research plans as explicit falsifiable prediction graphs significantly improves an agent pipeline's
  ability to detect negative results and avoid confirmation bias during scientific discovery.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: dataset_iter1_dir1
type: dataset
objective: >-
  Construct a benchmark suite of empirical ML research tasks and negative control settings with ground-truth failure labels.
approach: >-
  Build programmatic test scenarios with true positive and negative control setups (permuted labels, noise features) for agent
  planning evaluation.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

# Multi-agent LLM systems — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: task-solving LLM multi-agent systems (classical non-LLM MARL and societal simulation are different
literatures). The star is the SUBSTRATE below — a dated, source-anchored map of where the field stands mid-2026,
with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions; nothing here prescribes a direction. Every
[Sn] resolves to a verbatim quote in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md); date-sensitive figures live in [volatile.md](volatile.md).

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- The newest synthesis organizes the field as the LIFE progression — Lay the capability foundation → Integrate
  through collaboration → Find faults through attribution → Evolve through self-improvement — with the F→E
  handoff as its named weak link [S2].
- The failure locus is coordination, not member capability: errors propagate across agents and interaction
  rounds, are hard to diagnose, and rarely feed back into structure [S2] [S1].
- The field's working null hypothesis is economic: token spend, not architecture, explains most performance
  variance, so any structural claim is judged against matched-compute aggregation [S3] [S7].
- That null now has a theory: at a fixed reasoning-token budget with perfect context use, a single agent is more
  information-efficient (Data Processing Inequality — each handoff can only lose information); MAS is predicted
  competitive only where context use degrades or more compute is spent [S6].
- Verification is treated as easier than generation, so verifier count is a live test-time scaling axis [S15] —
  but self-evaluation without an external signal is known to fail and can degrade answers [S16].
- Inter-agent natural language is a chosen tradeoff, not a given: interpretable and overseeable, but argued
  structurally misaligned with the vector spaces models compute in (information loss, behavioral drift) [S18].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

### Structure vs matched compute (weight-capped here — the saturated core, see repeller)

- First systematic multi-agent-debate evaluation (5 MAD methods × 9 benchmarks × 4 models): MAD often fails to
  beat single-agent CoT / Self-Consistency even at much higher inference compute; the one robust lever found is
  model heterogeneity, named a universal antidote [S7] (2025-02, rev 2025-06).
- The critique now has a theory, not just benchmarks: the Data Processing Inequality argument predicts exactly
  when MAS becomes competitive — degraded single-agent context use, or extra compute [S6] (2026-04).

### Topology & orchestration

- Adaptive/learned MAS optimized per-benchmark show "topological overfitting" (no cross-domain transfer) and
  "illusory coordination" (surface accuracy while interactions diverge from intended behavior) [S9] (2026-04).
- Live counter-current: task-adaptive topology routing (parallel / sequential / hierarchical / hybrid per task)
  reports 12–23% over static single-topology baselines at identical models — single-author preprint, directly
  clashing with [S9]; see Open questions [S10] (2026-02).

### Failure, attribution & repair

- MAST is the field's failure instrument — exact figures (commonly mis-recalled): taxonomy built from 150 traces
  (kappa = 0.88), 14 modes / 3 categories; MAST-Data = 1600+ annotated traces, 7 frameworks [S1] (2025-03, rev 2025-10).
- Failure attribution (which agent, which step) is formalized and benchmarked — and far from solved: the best
  automated method reaches 53.5% (Who&When, ICML 2025 Spotlight) [S12] (2025-04).
- Verifier/critic agents act with a DELAY, so false claims propagate before correction — yielding instability
  thresholds and optimal corrector placement (single-author preprint) [S13] (2026-06).
- E-stage methods arriving: TPGO treats the MAS as a graph of optimizable nodes and derives textual feedback
  from execution traces to pinpoint failures and suggest granular edits [S14] (2026-04).

### Communication & interop

- The latent-communication thread passes continuous hidden states between agents on the premise that
  downsampling thought to discrete tokens loses information — a heavily occupied lane [S17] (2025-11).
- Protocol scope split a reviewer expects you to know: MCP = model↔tools/data (a single open standard replacing
  per-source connectors); A2A = agent↔agent, explicitly complementary to MCP [S4] (2024-11) · [S5] (2025-04).

### Evaluation & economics

- MAS eval has moved past final accuracy: MultiAgentBench (ACL 2025) scores collaboration quality with
  milestone-based KPIs and compares coordination protocols (star / chain / tree / graph) [S20] (2025-03).
- First independent (non-vendor) cost-accuracy Pareto: over 4 orchestration patterns × 5 LLMs on 10,000
  financial documents, reflexive tops F1 (0.943) at 2.3× cost; hierarchical supervisor-worker sits on the
  Pareto frontier (F1 0.921 at 1.4×) [S21] (2026-03).

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed)

- Multi-Agent Verification: scale the NUMBER of off-the-shelf aspect verifiers (binary approve/reject, no
  training) as the test-time axis — verification, not more debate rounds [S15] (2025-02).
- The two production-craft poles, both vendor-staked (2025-06): Cognition — reliability = context engineering on
  ONE thread [S19]; Anthropic — MAS pays off on parallel-heavy, context-exceeding, tool-heavy tasks at ~15× token cost [S3].
- Position line naming the comms tension: NL is structurally misaligned with LLM vector spaces —
  interpretability bought at an information cost [S18] (2025-06).

## Durable core (the few foundations that still hold)

- Du et al. 2023 — the founding "debate improves reasoning" result; the baseline the skeptic line attacks [S23].
- Mixture-of-Agents — layered aggregation, each layer reads all prior-layer outputs; 65.1 vs 57.5 (GPT-4 Omni)
  on AlpacaEval 2.0 — read as aggregation until cost-matched [S22].
- MetaGPT — canonical role-crew/SOP assembly line; the hand-designed baseline learned methods must beat [S24].
- LLMs cannot reliably self-correct reasoning without external feedback (ICLR 2024) [S16].
- ADAS — the learned-topology transfer CLAIM (a meta agent programs new agents in code; claims cross-domain
  robustness) — now directly contested, see Open questions [S11].
- "More Agents Is All You Need" — agent-count scaling via sampling-and-voting; reread today as self-consistency [S25].

## Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- Compute-matched "does MAS beat a single agent per $": benchmark wave + DPI theory + newest entrant showing
  auto-generated MAS underperform CoT-SC at up to 10× the cost — the field's loudest thread [S6] [S8].
- Adaptive/learned topology AND its rebuttal: both the method line and the "topological overfitting / illusory
  coordination" critique are published [S10] [S9].
- Failure attribution (which agent/step): named benchmark plus a dense 2026 follow-on wave [S12].
- Latent / vector inter-agent communication (hidden-state, KV-cache variants) — already has a unifying survey [S17].
- Self-evolving / self-improving MAS: dense H1-2026 wave of frameworks that learn to evolve from execution
  feedback, plus a dedicated survey [S14].
- Building new interop protocols: MCP + A2A are standardized, vendor-backed, foundation-governed — compose on
  them instead of proposing another [S4] [S5].

## Open questions the field hasn't answered (the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)

1. Once inference compute, sample aggregation, and context-window relief are controlled, what residual — if
   any — do the agentic ingredients (roles, personas, turn-taking, inter-agent dialogue) contribute, and on
   which task families? The theory predicts MAS wins only under degraded context use or extra compute [S6] [S7];
   no result yet isolates the residual itself.
2. What makes a critique or verification signal genuinely EXTERNAL? Self-correction fails without external
   feedback [S16], task verification is one of MAST's three failure categories [S1] — so does a same-family
   peer critic count as external, and where exactly is the boundary?
3. Same object, opposite 2026 verdicts: task-adaptive topology reports +12–23% at identical models [S10], while
   independent evaluation finds adaptive MAS overfit topologically with illusory coordination [S9], and the
   claimed cross-domain transfer of searched designs [S11] is measured as no advantage over CoT-SC [S8]. Under
   what conditions does learned structure transfer, and what evaluation separates real coordination from
   surface accuracy?
4. Why do diagnosed failures rarely translate into structural self-improvement [S2]? Attribution is benchmarked
   (best 53.5% [S12]) and typed blame signals exist [S1] — what is missing between a localized, typed fault and
   a safe structural change (the survey's own closed-loop agenda [S2])?
5. Can MAS reliability be predicted before running rather than measured after? Error propagation is the named
   failure locus [S2], delay effects already yield instability thresholds and corrector-placement results [S13],
   and a 1600+-trace corpus exists to fit against [S1] — yet there is no compositional account mapping
   per-agent error rates + topology to system reliability.
6. Is model-pool heterogeneity the actual mechanism behind reported multi-agent gains? It is the quoted
   "universal antidote" and the named reopening condition for the buried debate line [S7] — would a
   matched-compute heterogeneous pool beat self-consistency over the single best model?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ship another MAS framework: +X% on one benchmark, unmatched compute, no failure analysis | The rewarded move is a reusable diagnostic instrument — MAST, "the first Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy"; recognition = independent adoption (IBM applied it to turn raw ITBench traces into structured failure signatures) | problematizes-nothing — the field's own critique names weak baselines / limited coverage as the incremental signature | L·B | [S1] [S26] [S7] |
| Homogeneous multi-agent debate as a reasoning booster | Buried (2025-02→06): MAD often loses to CoT/Self-Consistency at higher compute. Reopening condition, per the same paper: model-heterogeneous pools at matched compute | dead-end | L | [S7] |
| Intrinsic self-correction — an agent repairing its own reasoning with no external signal | Buried (2023-10, ICLR 2024): performance can even degrade after self-correction. Reopens only with an external correction signal (tools, execution, ground truth); whether a same-family peer counts is unresolved | dead-end | L | [S16] |
| "More homogeneous agents = collaboration advance" (agent-count scaling) | Buried: the effect is sampling-and-voting — reproducible by self-consistency, and single-agent is information-optimal at matched budget. Reopens if structured, communicating agents beat a matched-token aggregation-only arm | dead-end | L | [S25] [S7] [S6] |

Science-vs-application, as this field draws it: the science bar is a matched-compute, failure-analyzed,
mechanism-attributing claim (the critique's demand to rethink evaluation and stop overvaluing MAD as-is [S7]);
a working framework with a headline delta and no failure analysis is application-tier [S7] [S1].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Compare the MAS against one weak single call, or at unmatched spend | Designing the comparison: equalize TOTAL tokens and $ across arms; report accuracy-vs-cost, expecting MAD-loses-to-CoT/SC as the outcome to beat | wrong-result — the gain may be purchased compute, not method | L | [S7] [S6] |
| Attribute a win to collaboration/structure directly | Before claiming structure: add a matched-token aggregation-only arm (same N samples + vote/judge, no roles or dialogue); structure must beat THAT | wrong-result — aggregation alone reproduces debate-like gains | L | [S7] [S25] |
| Mix model pools freely, or test a single model | Choosing pools: run homogeneous and heterogeneous pools as an explicit factor — heterogeneity is the named confound and lever | wrong-result — pool diversity, not the mechanism, may carry the gain | L | [S7] |
| Report top-line accuracy only | Reporting: annotate traces against MAST (14 modes / 3 categories) and give the failure-mode distribution; add collaboration/process metrics, not just completion | wasted-cost — unactionable eval; reads incremental in 2026 | L | [S1] [S20] |
| Claim MAS superiority in general | Writing the claim: scope to the predicted-win regime (degraded single-agent context use, or more compute [S6]; value covering ~15× tokens [S3]) and name where it should NOT help (shared-context work) | wrong-result — overclaim against the known boundary invites the skeptic line | L·B·C | [S6] [S3] [S19] |
| Review a "new MAS framework" on its own terms | Reviewing: map it onto the settled canon — debate, MoA/voting, role-crews, learned topology search — and demand the explicit delta vs the nearest | wrong-result — re-skins ship as novel | L | [S23] [S22] [S24] [S11] |

## Decision guide

- Shared-context, dependency-dense work (most coding): single thread + context engineering is the
  production-proven pole [S19]; go multi-agent where single-agent context use degrades or more compute is
  justified [S6] and task value covers ~15× tokens [S3]. Both poles are vendor-staked — see SOURCES.
- Picking an orchestration pattern under a budget: the one independent Pareto study puts hierarchical
  supervisor-worker on the cost-accuracy frontier (F1 0.921 at 1.4×), reflexive best-but-2.3× — scoped to
  financial-document extraction [S21].
- Spending test-time compute: verifier COUNT is a demonstrated scaling axis [S15]; more debate rounds is not
  [S7]; a critique signal must be external to count [S16].
- Verifier placement: verification acts with delay, so false claims propagate before correction —
  placement/timing, not mere presence, is the lever (single-author framing) [S13].
- Interop plumbing: MCP for model↔tools/data, A2A for agent↔agent — explicitly complementary; pick by scope
  rather than conflating them [S4] [S5].

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- MAS ≈ 15× chat tokens; token usage alone ≈ 80% of variance — vendor-internal, single-origin figures [S3].
- Settled canon a novelty claim must clear: multi-agent debate [S23] · MoA / layered aggregation [S22] ·
  role-crews / SOP pipelines [S24] · learned topology search [S11].
- MAST's three failure categories: system design issues · inter-agent misalignment · task verification [S1].
- MoA's 65.1 vs 57.5 (AlpacaEval 2.0) is an aggregation result — cost-match before citing it as a multi-agent win [S22].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — every date/version-sensitive figure above (trace counts, SOTA numbers,
  cost anchors, the crowded list's shelf life); re-check before relying on any number.
- **[SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md)** — provenance: every [Sn] with tier, reliable-for scope, and verbatim quote.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ "Attribution→repair is now tractable" is INFERRED, not quoted: typed blame signals + a 1600+-trace corpus
  exist [S1] and the survey names the F→E gap and a closed-loop agenda [S2], but no fetched source states the
  repair loop is newly enabled; known E-stage work optimizes orchestration rather than closing
  attribution-driven, non-regression-verified repair. Confirm: a 2026 paper citing attribution artifacts as its
  enabler and verifying non-regression. Refute: such a paper exists → treat this lane as crowded too.
- ⚠️ "Compositional reliability theory is uncrowded" rests on a single scan: adjacent work exists (delay /
  instability thresholds [S13]) but no per-agent-error→system-reliability composition theory was found — low
  confidence. Confirm or refute with a fresh search for a MAS reliability-calculus paper before investing.
- ⚠️ Taste anchor is substituted: the DEEP exemplar's award/meta-review rationale was not recoverable (review
  page access-gated), so the taste row rests on adoption-by-reference (IBM applying MAST [S26]) rather than a
  committee rationale. Confirm: recover the venue meta-review or an equivalent award rationale and check it
  names the same separating cue.
