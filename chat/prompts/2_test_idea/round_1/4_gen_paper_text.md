<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for related-work positioning and how this field frames a genuinely novel contribution.

<hypothesis>
The research hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Falsifiable Plans Improve Agent Negative Result Detection
hypothesis: >-
  Structuring automated research plans as explicit falsifiable prediction graphs rather than procedural task lists significantly
  increases an agent pipeline's negative result detection rate and reduces false positive claims of success.
motivation: >-
  Automated scientific discovery systems (such as AI Scientist agents) frequently suffer from confirmation bias, tending to
  interpret ambiguous or failed experimental outcomes as successes and persisting down unpromising research dead ends. While
  prior work addresses hypothesis validation post-hoc, no existing system enforces structural falsifiability during the research
  planning phase. By integrating Popperian falsification directly into automated research plans, pipelines can systematically
  recognize negative results, enforce rigorous stopping criteria, and redirect search trajectories.
assumptions:
- >-
  Automated agent pipelines can reliably parse and execute research plans structured with explicit falsifiable prediction
  predicates.
- >-
  Quantitative thresholding of metrics (e.g., performance delta over baselines, statistical significance bounds) can objectively
  define falsification for empirical ML and science tasks.
- >-
  LLM agents generating research plans can be successfully prompted or constrained to formulate falsifiable predictions alongside
  experimental steps.
investigation_approach: >-
  We construct a benchmark suite of empirical research tasks (including both true positive methods and negative control settings
  where proposed methods fail). We compare two automated agent planning architectures: (1) Standard Procedural Planners and
  (2) Falsifiable Prediction Graph Planners. We measure Negative Result Detection Rate (True Positive Rate for identifying
  failed hypotheses), False Positive Rate (hallucinated successes), and search iteration efficiency.
success_criteria: >-
  Confirmation: The Falsifiable Prediction Graph planner achieves a statistically significantly higher Negative Result Detection
  Rate (>25% absolute improvement) and lower false positive rate on negative control tasks compared to the standard procedural
  planner. Disconfirmation: No significant difference in negative result detection rates or search efficiency between falsifiable
  graphs and standard procedural plans.
related_works:
- >-
  POPPER (Huang et al., 2025): An agentic framework for validating free-form hypotheses using sequential falsification experiments.
  Difference: POPPER validates existing hypotheses post-hoc against external data/experiments, whereas our hypothesis investigates
  structuring the research plan itself as explicit falsifiable predictions to govern automated pipeline execution and real-time
  negative result detection.
- >-
  The AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024): Fully automated scientific discovery system using LLMs. Difference: Uses standard procedural
  planning and is prone to confirmation bias and missing negative results; our approach introduces structural falsifiability
  into the planning phase to enhance self-correction.
inspiration: >-
  Inspired by Karl Popper's philosophy of scientific methodology (conjecture and refutation) and control theory feedback loops,
  adapting rigorous falsifiability constraints from philosophy of science into agentic workflow planning.
terms:
- term: Falsifiable Prediction Graph
  definition: >-
    A research plan structured as a directed acyclic graph of conditional hypotheses where every experimental node includes
    explicit quantitative refutation criteria.
- term: Negative Result Detection Rate
  definition: >-
    The proportion of experiments with null or failed outcomes that the automated pipeline correctly identifies as negative
    rather than misinterpreting as success.
- term: Confirmation Bias in Agents
  definition: >-
    The tendency of LLM-based research agents to interpret ambiguous or negative empirical results as supporting their proposed
    method.
summary: >-
  Structuring automated research plans as explicit falsifiable prediction graphs significantly improves an agent pipeline's
  ability to detect negative results and avoid confirmation bias during scientific discovery.

title: Agent Falsifiability Benchmark Suite
summary: >-
  This dataset artifact constructs the Agent Falsifiability Benchmark Suite, which provides a rigorous collection of 10 diverse
  empirical machine learning research tasks spanning both classification and regression domains. Each research task scenario
  is meticulously paired with both a true positive condition representing valid methodological improvements and a negative
  control condition involving permuted labels or adversarial noise features with ground-truth failure outcomes. Furthermore,
  the dataset comes complete with explicit quantitative refutation criteria, row-level feature representations, and structured
  metadata enabling comprehensive evaluation of automated agent planning, negative result detection, and methodological falsifiability
  in iterative scientific discovery pipelines.

title: Falsifiable Plans for Negative Result Detection
summary: >-
  This experiment rigorously investigates and compares Falsifiable Prediction Graph Planners against Standard Procedural Planners
  across a comprehensive 30-task benchmark suite comprising both true positive empirical research tasks and rigorous negative
  control failure conditions. Automated scientific discovery pipelines frequently suffer from confirmation bias, chasing false
  positives and failing to detect fundamental negative results when tasks or hypotheses are fundamentally flawed. Our proposed
  Falsifiable Prediction Graph Planner enforces structured causal dependency graphs equipped with explicit mandatory refutation
  criteria and early negative control validation tests. Through systematic simulation runs across diverse domains including
  regression, classification, natural language processing, and time series analysis, we measure negative result detection
  rates, false positive rates, search efficiency (iterations), and statistical significance via Fisher's exact tests and t-tests.
  The empirical findings demonstrate that falsifiable prediction graph planning achieves a 100% negative result detection
  rate compared to 33.3% for standard procedural planners, eliminates false positives on negative controls (0% vs 66.7%),
  and significantly improves search efficiency (4.5 vs 9.7 mean iterations, p < 1e-18).

title: Evaluating Falsifiable Plans for Agent Negative Results
summary: >-
  This comprehensive evaluation artifact rigorously investigates the hypothesis that structuring research plans as explicit
  Popperian falsifiable prediction graphs significantly improves the rate at which automated agent pipelines detect their
  own negative results, avoid confirmation bias, and minimize false positive success claims. We compare Falsifiable Prediction
  Graph planners against standard procedural LLM agent planners across a diverse benchmark suite of 10 empirical machine learning
  research tasks spanning regression, binary classification, multi-class classification, and synthetic non-linear modeling.
  Our evaluation framework operationalizes core metrics including Negative Result Detection Rate (True Positive Rate for Negatives),
  False Positive Rate (Hallucinated Success Rate), Search Iteration Efficiency, and classification metrics (Precision, Recall,
  F1-score), complemented by rigorous statistical significance testing via Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U tests. The
  experimental results demonstrate that falsifiable graph planning achieves a 100% negative result detection rate with 0%
  false positives, substantially outperforming standard procedural planners (which exhibited a 40% detection rate and 60%
  false positive rate), while also improving search iteration efficiency with statistically significant p-values (p < 0.01).
  All evaluation outputs, mini/preview/full datasets, reproducible dependencies in pyproject.toml, and execution scripts are
  fully validated and documented.

<task>
Write a research paper draft with LaTeX-ready text, BibTeX citations, and figure placeholders.

This is the FIRST paper draft. Write a complete research paper from scratch based on the hypothesis and all available artifacts.
</task>

<figure_instructions>
FIGURE FORMAT: Use [FIGURE:fig_id] markers in paper_text to indicate where each figure goes.
Then provide the full figure specs in the separate `figures` structured output array.
Each figure in the array must have an `id` matching a marker in the text. Set the `aspect_ratio`
field per figure: 21:9 for architecture / pipeline / flow-chart diagrams (the hero figure should
be one of these — place its marker near the END of the Introduction so it floats to the top of
page 2), 16:9 for comparisons / multi-panel results, 4:3 for dense charts, 1:1 for heatmaps /
confusion matrices / scatter plots.

FIGURE TYPE — set `figure_type` on every figure. One test decides it: does the figure plot numbers?
  "data"    — a DATA FIGURE: bars, curves, scatter, heatmaps, confusion matrices, scaling
              laws, distributions, Pareto fronts, ablation deltas. Rendered deterministically
              from the values you supply, so every bar is exactly the height of its number.
  "concept" — a CONCEPT FIGURE: conceptual artwork, architecture and flow diagrams, anything
              with no underlying dataset. Drawn by an image model.
If the figure has real numbers behind it, ALWAYS use "data". An image model only approximates
values: the bars come back close to, but not equal to, the numbers you asked for, and nothing
downstream detects it.

Example in paper_text:
  "...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\nThe results demonstrate..."

Example in figures array (results comparison — plots numbers, so a data figure):
  {"id": "fig3", "title": "Performance Comparison", "figure_type": "data", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. Categories: PostgreSQL, Bao, RLQOpt. One series 'Latency'. Values: 4.6, 2.8, 2.0 seconds. Errors: 0.8, 0.5, 0.3. X-axis label 'Optimizer'. Y-axis label 'Latency (s)', range 0-5.", "aspect_ratio": "16:9", "summary": "Compares latency across optimizers"}

Example in figures array (architecture diagram, hero — no dataset, so a concept figure):
  {"id": "fig1", "title": "System Architecture", "figure_type": "concept", "caption": "End-to-end pipeline: encoder feeds latents into the planner, which queries the value head before emitting actions.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Horizontal flow diagram, left to right. Five labeled boxes: 'Input' (gray), 'Encoder' (blue), 'Latent (z, 256-dim)' (light blue, narrow), 'Planner' (green), 'Action Head' (orange). Arrows labeled with shapes. Value head as separate green box below 'Planner', bidirectional arrow. Sans-serif font, clean white background, no 3D.", "aspect_ratio": "21:9", "summary": "Hero architecture diagram"}

CRITICAL: Before writing figure specs, look through artifact workspace output files (*_out.json)
and code to find ALL the exact values. The figure generator cannot read files — every exact number
and value MUST be in the image_gen_detailed_description. For a "data" figure, list the values per series
plus the axis labels and units; the renderer needs the numbers themselves, not a description of
what they look like.
</figure_instructions>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-writing, aii-semscholar-bib.
TODO 2. LITERATURE REVIEW: Use web search tools to research the landscape — search key terms from
<hypothesis> and <all_artifacts>. Then use aii_semscholar_bib__fetch to batch-fetch real
BibTeX entries. Build a comprehensive Related Work section. Do NOT fabricate entries.
TODO 3. READ ARTIFACTS: Before writing each section, READ the relevant artifact source code, output
files, and data in the workspace. Extract concrete implementation details, technical innovations,
algorithmic specifics, and quantitative results. Do NOT write surface-level descriptions.

ARTIFACT REFERENCES: When you reference results, methodology, or findings from a specific artifact,
place an [ARTIFACT:artifact_id] marker inline. These become footnotes linking to the artifact's code
in the GitHub repository (first mention gets a footnote with URL, subsequent mentions are omitted).
Use the exact artifact ID from <all_artifacts>. Place the marker right after the claim it supports.
Example:
  "Our evaluation showed a 15% improvement over baselines [ARTIFACT:art_4f9d2c81ab37]." 
TODO 4. WRITE PAPER: Write the full paper text with [FIGURE:fig_id] markers per <figure_instructions>,
and provide the figure specs in the figures array. Cite with numeric references [1], [2], etc.
At the end of the paper text, include a full bibliography section. Do NOT compile LaTeX or generate
actual image/figure files. Your ONLY output is the structured JSON.

## Technical Papers

Guidance for the standard "technical paper" format: propose a method/system/framework, evaluate it experimentally, report results. This is the main track at most CS venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, etc.). Does NOT cover: pure theory/formal proofs, survey papers, position papers, or dataset/benchmark papers — those have different structures.

### Paper Structure

Target 6-8 pages. Use formal academic language, third person. Support claims with evidence from artifacts.

#### Rough Page Budget (8-page paper)

| Section | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Abstract | 0.3 | Problem, approach, key result |
| Introduction | 1.0-1.5 | The most important section |
| Related Work | 0.5-1.0 | Beginning or end (see below) |
| Methods | 1.5-2.0 | Architecture fig on page 1 |
| Experiments | 1.5-2.0 | Setup + results + ablations |
| Discussion | 0.5-1.0 | Limitations go here |
| Conclusion | 0.3-0.5 | Do not repeat the abstract |
| References | 0.5-1.0 | Not counted in page limit |

**Critical rule**: A clear new technical contribution must be articulated by page 3 (quarter of the paper). If the reader doesn't know what you did by then, you've lost them.

#### Section Details

**Abstract** (150-250 words): State the problem, your approach, and the main results. Be factual and comprehensive. Do not repeat the abstract word-for-word later in the paper.

**Introduction** — Follow this 5-paragraph structure:

1. **What is the problem?** Define the task concretely.
2. **Why is it interesting and important?** Real-world impact, scale.
3. **Why is it hard?** Why do naive approaches fail?
4. **Why hasn't it been solved before?** What's wrong with prior solutions? How does yours differ?
5. **What are the key components of your approach and results?** Include specific limitations.

End with a "Summary of Contributions" subsection — bullet list of contributions with section references. This doubles as an outline, saving space.

**Related Work** — Placement decision:
- **Beginning** (Section 2): If it can be short yet detailed, or if you need a strong defensive stance against prior work early.
- **End** (before Conclusions): If comparisons require your technical content, or if it can be summarized briefly in the Introduction. Can be titled "Discussion and Related Work."

**Methods/Approach**: Every section tells a story — the story of the results, NOT the story of how you arrived at them. Use top-down description: readers should see where the material is going and be able to skip ahead. Move gory details to appendices.

**Experiments**: Setup (datasets, metrics, baselines) → main results → ablations → analysis. Every claim needs quantitative evidence.

**Discussion**: Interpret results, compare to prior work, state limitations honestly. Limitations should be specific and actionable, not vague disclaimers.

**Conclusion**: Short summarizing paragraph. Do NOT repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. Make original claims more concrete (e.g., reference quantitative results). Include future work as bullet list — if actively pursuing follow-up, say so to mark territory.

#### Writing Quality Rules

- Define all notation/terminology before use, only once. Group global definitions in Preliminaries.
- Do NOT use nonreferential "this", "that", "these", "it". Always specify the referent. BAD: "This is important because..." GOOD: "This accuracy gap is important because..."
- Do NOT use "etc." unless remaining items are completely obvious. BAD: "We measure volatility, scalability, etc." GOOD: "We measure volatility and scalability."
- Do NOT write "for various reasons" — state the actual reasons.
- "That" is defining, "which" is nondefining. "The algorithms that are easy to implement" vs "The algorithms, which are easy to implement."
- Use italics for definitions and quotes, not for emphasis. Context alone should provide emphasis.

### Figure Format

Figures use a hybrid marker + structured array approach. ALL figures are generated by a separate pipeline step using an AI image model — your `image_gen_detailed_description` is the ONLY input that model sees. It cannot read files or access data. Do NOT generate actual image files yourself (no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation scripts).

**In paper_text**: Place `[FIGURE:fig_id]` markers where figures should appear.

**In figures array**: Provide full specs as structured objects with these fields:
- `id` — matches the `[FIGURE:id]` marker in paper_text
- `title` — short descriptive title
- `caption` — LaTeX caption that appears below the figure in the paper
- `image_gen_detailed_description` — detailed prompt for the image generator (axes, ALL values, colors, layout)
- `summary` — brief summary of what the figure communicates

Example in paper_text:
```
...our method achieves state-of-the-art results as shown below.

[FIGURE:fig_1]

The results in Figure 1 demonstrate...
```

Example figure spec in figures array:
```json
{"id": "fig_1", "title": "Performance Comparison", "caption": "Comparison of geometric mean query latency across optimizers on JOB benchmark. RLQOpt achieves 2.3x speedup over PostgreSQL.", "image_gen_detailed_description": "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: ModelA=0.847, ModelB=0.762, Baseline=0.531. Error bars with std: 0.02, 0.03, 0.05. Sans-serif font, white background.", "summary": "Compares accuracy of proposed methods vs baseline."}
```

Every marker in text MUST have a matching figure in the array, and vice versa.

#### Data Precision Requirement

`image_gen_detailed_description` MUST include exact numbers from artifact output files. Read the actual output files before writing figure specs.

- BAD: "Compare accuracy metrics across configurations"
- GOOD: "Grouped bar chart. X-axis: model names. Y-axis: accuracy (0.0-1.0). Values: K=3: 0.765, K=5: 0.729, Baseline: 0.121."

#### Figure vs Table Decision

Do NOT create figures for tabular data (rows/columns of text or numbers). Use `\begin{table}` in LaTeX instead. Figures are for actual visualizations only (charts, plots, diagrams).

#### Figure Placement Strategy

Be intentional with figure ordering. The architectural/method overview figure explaining the proposed approach MUST appear early — in the Introduction or at the start of Methods — so readers can immediately orient themselves. Readers skim papers top-down; if the first figure they see is a results bar chart, they have no mental model for interpreting it.

Recommended ordering:
1. **Architecture/method diagram** — Introduction or early Methods (so readers understand the approach before diving into details)
2. **Conceptual/analogy figures** — Introduction or Methods (to build intuition)
3. **Results figures** (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots) — Results section
4. **Analysis/ablation figures** — Discussion or later Results

#### Guidelines

- Plan 3-6 figures total across the paper
- Place [FIGURE:fig_id] markers INLINE where referenced in text
- Include axes, labels, ALL numeric values in figure descriptions
- Both data-driven figures (bar charts, line plots) and conceptual diagrams (architecture, flowcharts)
- Be as detailed as possible in descriptions: specify aspect ratio, preferred colors, all data values, axis labels, ranges, legend entries, and any other visual details. The more specific the description, the better the generated figure

### Bibliography with Semantic Scholar

Build `./references.bib` using the aii-semscholar-bib skill (real BibTeX from Semantic Scholar):

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in one batch
3. Write the returned .bib text into `./references.bib`

Rules:
- Do NOT fabricate BibTeX entries — always fetch from Semantic Scholar
- If a paper isn't found (very recent preprint), write the entry manually as fallback
- Use `\bibliography{references}` and `\bibliographystyle{plainnat}`
- Do NOT use inline `thebibliography` environment

### Citation Format (for Research Artifacts)

When writing research with numbered citations:

1. Every factual claim MUST have a numbered citation: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 3]`, etc.
2. Each source in the "sources" array MUST have an "index" field
3. The index MUST EXACTLY MATCH citation numbers in the text
4. NEVER cite a number without a matching source index
5. Example: "LLMs show 40% improvement with multi-agent collaboration [1]."
